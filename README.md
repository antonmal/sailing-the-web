# Sailing the Web

A journey of a Web development apprentice

Hi, my name is Anton Malkov. I am a serial entrepreneur originally from Moscow, Russia, currently living in the beautiful Barcelona.

When I was a teenager I earned my first income programming as a freelancer. Now, 25 years later, I decided to re-learn programming and Web development and fell in love with it once again. Now I am going through the highly acclaimed Tealeaf Academy bootcamp hoping to work in this field professionally.

I will share what I find on this journey in this blog. If you are a fellow traveller, have a look from time to time and share your experience.
