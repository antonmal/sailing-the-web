!!! *"Learn to code"* movement has grown into something huge globally. Millions started coding for fun through nicely designed online courses from the likes of Codecademy, Treehouse or Code School. I enjoyed going through many of those over the last year. They allowed me to pick up basic concepts and syntax of many modern languages and frameworks. They helped bring back wonderful memories of how much I enjoyed coding at the age of 14-16 and inspired me to crave for more: to learn how professional developers work on real world projects and to become one myself. Luckily, just the moment I made this decision, a random newsletter from [Michael Hartl][mh] ended up in my inbox. He highly praised the [Tealeaf Academy][tl] bootcamps, so I decided to give them a try. And I could not be happier about the result.

Looking back at the first two courses that I just completed, I cannot remember a moment when I did not thoroughly enjoy every video, live session, book and assignment. It is so no-BS, down-to-earth, in-depth and simply fun that I ended up running to my computer to keep churning through the course as soon as my other tasks would allow.

Not only did I enjoy the courses, but I feel like I grew a lot as a developer. So before I move on to the next, professional-level bootcamp from Tealeaf, I decided to look back and remember what I've learned already.

Chris Lee, the Tealeaf's main instructor, kept saying: "It's not enough to understand programming concepts or syntax of a language. You need to practice these over and over again until they are part of your muscle memory. You need to make coding an almost unconscious activity, like speaking, so that you can focus on the problem you are solving, the requirements and higher-level software design." Chris did not just preach that, he gave us lots of opportunities to apply this piece of wisdom. And for that I am grateful the most. All of the bits and pieces that I acquired before, through much practice and repetition got systematized and used without much thinking or googling, thus freeing me to create and be creative in programming.

I also learned the great value of reading other people's code. Tealeaf offers a lot of chances for that. Everyone gets the same assignments and you can review and discuss what other students did. You can also participate in code competitions which encourage you to analyze other solutions and vote for the best. You also go though detailed walk-throughs that show how an experienced developer tackles software problems. We also went through a few examples of brilliant [Exercism][ex] exercises. There this principle is applied perfectly: you post your solution, get feedback from more experienced developers, give your feedback to others, and in the process learn lots of tips and tricks about the language (Ruby in my case) and about best practices of software design. I also looked at the code of many open-source projects written in Ruby. Spend as much time studying other persons' code as you do coding to greatly shorten the learning curve. Extra bonus: you will become better prepared to work on one team with other developers, more familiar with different coding styles and software design approaches.

Here I shared some higher-level learning points, but of course I picked up a lot of technical stuff as well. There is simply too much of it to cover in a short post like this. I will share bits and pieces over time in this blog, so keep coming back if you are on a similar journey! And feel free to share your thoughts in the comments. Kudos!
