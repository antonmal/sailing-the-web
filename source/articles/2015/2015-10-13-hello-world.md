![The journey begins](path.jpg)

I am on a journey. As an apprentice. Of the not-so-ancient art of web app development.

I will share my journey here with you, world. I will expose the dead ends and hopefully some shortcuts and stashes of gold that I find along the way.

**My path will definitely include:**

1. Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails
2. Testing with Minitest, RSpec, factory_girl, capibara
3. JavaScript, jQuery and CoffeeScript
4. HTML, CSS, SASS, LESS
5. ERB, Haml, Handlebars, Markdown, Liquid
6. Bootstrap and Foundation
7. mySQL, MongoDB and Postgres
8. Node.js, Ember.js and React.js
9. Terminal, RVM, homebrew
10. Git, GitHub, SVN
11. Amazon AWS
12. The inner workings of HTTP
13. Building and using APIs
14. Working with JSON and XML
15. Agile project management with Scrum, Kanban and tools like JIRA
16. Mockups with Balsamiq and other tools
17. Sketch for beautiful web design
18. Swift for iOS
19. Google Analytics, KISSmetrics, Mixpanel
20. SEO, SEM, SMM, content marketing
21. Growth hacking
22. IT statrups
23. Venture investments
24. Beautiful photography
25. Lifehacks
26. *...And who knows what else...*

Let's stay in touch, world! See you at the next stop! :)
